// JavaScript Program for Making a New Set with Unique Elements in it //

// As we know that Set() only comprises of only unique elements in it. So we will just pass an array inside a new set.

let randomArray = ["a","a","b","a","b","a","b","c","d","d"];

let unique = new Set(randomArray);

console.log(unique);
